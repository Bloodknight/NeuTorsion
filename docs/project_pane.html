	<h2>Project Pane</h2>
	<p>The project pane is a live updated list of the files and folders in your working directory.  Unlike other editors where you must manually manage which files are visible in the project tree, Torsion just displays them all with some simple filters.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<h4>Toolbar</h4>
	<h5>Show All Mods</h5>
	This toggles between showing all the "mod" folders in the project working directory and just the mods selected in the project settings.
	<h5>Show All Files</h5>
	This toggles between showing just script files and all the files in the working directory.
	<h5>Delete DSOs</h5>
	This deletes all the DSO compiled script files from in the working directory.
	<h5>Sync With Editor</h5>
	When enabled the project pane will ensure that the current active file is always selected in the tree.
	<h5>Refresh</h5>
	Although the project pane is automatically updated, this button is here just in case something fails to appear.

	<h4>Project Tree</h4>
	The project tree itself supports right click context menus and drag and drop between folders for moving and copying items.
