	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>We're glad you have chosen to use the <b>Torsion TorqueScript IDE</b>.
	</p>

	<h2>What is Torsion?</h2>
	<p>Torsion is an integrated development environment specifically for creating and debugging TorqueScript based games and mods.  It does not edit C++ source, have a WYSIWYG GUI editor, or work with TorqueX C# code...  Torsion is solely focused on C++ Torque engine development using TorqueScript.  Torsion is a complement to the existing tools and editors that ship with the various Torque C++ engines.
	</p>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
