	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	
	<p>
	<b>Q: It seems the watch window doesn't evaluate variables properly... is this a bug?</b></p>
	<p>
	A: Yes it is a bug.  In particular it was a bug in the TelnetDebugger that seems to be fixed for TGE and TGB, but not for TGEA.  There is a <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/mg/forums/result.thread.php?qt=48310">bug fix posted here</a>.

	<p>
	<b>Q: Why can i not step thru code or set breakpoints on code outside of functions?</b></p>
	<p>
	A: By default the Torque engines disable this feature for performance.  Although it is arguable if it is much of a win at all, the extra breaklines is not enabled in release builds by default.  Open <i>engine\console\astNodes.cc/cpp</i> and enable the <b>TORQUE_EXTRA_BREAKLINES</b> define and rebuild your executable.
	</p>
	<br>

	<p><b>Q: When i launch my game using Torsion nothing happens... what is wrong?</b></p>
	<p>
	A: Most likely you've tried to run your game from inside a mod folder.  Your project working directory should contain the subdirectory where you game scripts are and be the same folder where the Torque executable and entry script exist.
