# Torsion

Torsion is a powerful development environment for creating TorqueScript based games and mods.

**WARNING:** Torsion currently needs a [new XML libary](https://github.com/SickheadGames/Torsion/issues/1) and possibly an [update of VisualStudio](https://github.com/SickheadGames/Torsion/issues/7) before it can compile and run again.
